<h1> The Fox & The Grapes </h1>
<hr />

<p> One afternoon a fox was walking through the forest and spotted a bunch of grapes hanging from over a lofty branch. </p>
<p> <b> "Just the thing to quench my thirst," </b> he thought. </p>
<p> Taking a few steps back, the fox jumped and just missed the hanging grapes. Again the fox took a few paces back and tried to reach them but still failed. </p>
<p> Finally, giving up, the fox turned up his nose and said,<b>"They're probably sour anyway," </b> and proceeded to walk away. </p>
